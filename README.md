# :two_hearts: Tinder-Attempt   

 Since I met my wife throught Tinder (yes, really!). This is my attempt to build the Tinder dating app using smart contracts.
 
 ## ðŸŽ® The Game 

The game is the exact same as Tinder. Register an account, swipe left for "not interested", swipe right for "interested to date". If both you and your date swipes right, then you get a "match", and permission will be granted for you to chat with your match. 

Front-end and more features will be developed.
